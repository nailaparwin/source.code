Task to do
================
Find Energy for a list of given displacement values

Input
-------
we have folders named as -1,-0.9, -0.8, -0.7, ...,0,0.1, 0.2, 0.3,....0.9,1
Each folder contains input vasp files to run
The name of folders represents the displacement values

Process
---------
1. run all vasp simulations using script run_dir_with_points.sh
2. copy all outcar files in a separate folder (optional not compulsory step) using script cp.sh
3. find out energy values using python script extract_info_plus.py and extract_info_minus.py

Output
---------
data_pos.xlsx
data_neg.xlsx

Final Output
_______________
DispEnergy.xlsx



Details
-------------------
1. It will work in two steps. We have all negative named folders in one dir and all positive named folders in another dir.
2. We have a list of displacement values from negative numbers to positive numbers
3. To keep the order same in output file when we read negative folders the values go from folder 1 to 0.1 and 
to read positive folders values go from 0,0.1 to 1
4. There will be two output files. To make the final output file copy data from both files in a new file manually

P.S. minus folder indicate negative folders. They does not contain negative sign actually
