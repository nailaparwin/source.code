Sample INPUT
===============
This source code takes input four files. They are inside init folder.
INCAR
POSCAR
POTCAR
KPOINTS

PROCESS 1
==============
1. PSTRESS is a variable in INCAR file
2. Using sample input files we want to create multiple input files with different values of PSTRESS
3. The values of PSTRESS should be 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, .....,100
4. Create a new input folder for each value of PSTRESS like files_0, files_5, files_10 and so on
5. only PSTRESS value is different in each INCAR file. Rest of the files are same in all folders. copied only
6. "run" is shell script to prepare input files
7. we can execute this file using ./run on command prompt
8. This shell script will also run the simulation on vasp using 16 cores and produce OUTCAR files

PROCESS 2
=====================
1. After creating and running all simulations consider OUTCAR files from all folders
2 Create an excel sheet having values of positions of atoms(a, b, c), energy (toten) and external pressure
for each outcar file using python script "extract_info.py" 
3. Take the last entry from each excel file and write into a new excel file pstress_0_100.xlsx. This is the target 
output file

OUTPUT
==========
pstress_0_100.xlsx

Source Code
============
1) run => This is a shell script to prepare input folders and run all simulations on vasp
2) extract_info.py => This is a python script to create all individual excel files.
