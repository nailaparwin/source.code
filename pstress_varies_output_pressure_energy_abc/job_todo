===================
change PSTRESS parameter in INCAR file. provide values 0, 5, 10, 15 .... 100 like PSTRESS = 0 and run vasp when completes. set PSTRESS = 5 and run vasp ....

write script to perform above tasks.
(I have deleted PSTRESS from original file to make task easy)
There are three script files run, extract_info.py and final.py

run will create input files and run them on vasp
extract_info will analyse OUTCAR files and collect all values for energy, pressure and positions of atoms from each OUTCAR file
